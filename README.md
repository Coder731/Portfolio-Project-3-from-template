	- navigated to [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
	- Clicked on Create new app
	- named app uniquely
	-set region to Europe
	- Clicked create app
	- Used Settings tab to set settings
		- Clicked Reveal Config vars

# Other Notes

## Multiple README files Explanation
There are currently 3 README files:
1. This one, README.md is the main README here in root directory
2. [README2.md](readme_for_template/README2.md) is the second README, which comes with the [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) used

## Development Continued

### Phase 0
Error present in terminal: 
- flake8 error E231 
- Fixed by using: [flake8 error E231 after a successful black run #1289](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1289)
    - step 1: try to run black run.py
        - black not installed
    - step 2: pip3 install black 
    - step 3: black run.py
    - step 4: flake8 run.py

#### Error with gitpod.yml
- gitpod.yml ms-toolsai.jupyter extension is not synced, but not added in .gitpod.yml
- fixed by clicking on i in image in gitpod.yml to see error message, and addressing this.

### Phase 1
print statement is now running

### Phase 2
run:
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
this adds the following dependencies to the requirements.txt file:

black==21.8b0
click==8.0.1
pathspec==0.9.0
regex==2021.8.28
tomli==1.2.1

### Phase 3 Board Display
- Add vertical lines (pipes) between squares horizontally
- Add underscores between squares vertically

### Phase 4 Display two sequential boards
- Board A
    - Present choice to user
- Board B
    - Display user choice

## Debugging
 ### Bug Brackets displaying on board
 Description
 - Brackets displaying
 Solution
 - Display board without brackets.

## Checking win condition 
### Vertical three in a line
Image showing debugging using python tutor of subset of code dealing with checking for three O's in a line vertically.

Shows program exits as expected for three O's vertically in line, indicating this piece of code has been fixed.
![python_tutor_fixing_three_vertically.png](assets/images/python_tutor_fixing_three_vertically.png)

Same python tutor debugging step as above, but showing the part of is game over function checking for three in a line vertically.

### Complex Bug
Keywords for Error:
- Flake Error with Syntax Error with conversion of values List to Dictionary 

Flake Error:
Erorr Message:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Erorr Detail:
- {
	"resource": "/workspace/Portfolio-Project-3-from-template/run.py",
	"owner": "python",
	"code": "E999",
	"severity": 8,
	"message": "SyntaxError: invalid syntax",
	"source": "flake8",
	"startLineNumber": 27,
	"startColumn": 12,
	"endLineNumber": 27,
	"endColumn": 12
}
Error Further Information:
- Error appears in Problems Section of Gitpod/VSCode IDE beside  Output and Terminal tabs

Attempted Solution:
- Searched error


### RecursionError Bug [Resolved]
Problem: maximum recursion depth exceeded
Steps to recreate:
Trying to print final board after a player wins
	- added two functions:
		- interim
		  and
		- print_final_board
	- added two if conditons from print_final_board to print_board
	- ran program run.py in terminal
Image of feedback from terminal:

- recursion error
![recursion_error.png](assets/images/recursion_error.png)

- Attempted Solution
	- Removed interim and print_final_board functions
	- left extra if statements in print_board function
- Same error message but slightly different output

- recursion error two 
![recursion_error_two.png](assets/images/recursion_error_two.png)

- Debugging EOFError 
![Debugging EOFError](assets/images/debugging_eoferror.png)
- Potential Solution
	- Could use try catch exception handling
- Next Step
	- Cut interim function
New error: interim function name error
![interim name error](assets/images/interim_name_error.png)
- Next Step:
	- Remove all interim function calls
- Bug has been Resolved

### Final board not displaying after win Bug [Resolved]
Error:
	- SyntaxError: name 'game_is_over' is assigned to before global declaration
Attempted Solution:
	- Searched Error

Result:
Reference:
- [SyntaxWarning: name 'item' is assigned to before global declaration global item](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53528532/syntaxwarning-name-item-is-assigned-to-before-global-declaration-global-item)
- Reference recommendation:
	- Remove global keyword from within loop
Resolved

### Board not Displaying after win Bug [Resolved]
Bug:
- Board does not display after winning
Solution:
- Add game_is_over variable set to False
- For any of the three loops in is_game_over() function, 
	if condition is satisfied,
	- set game_is_over variable to True
	- call print_board() function


## Note on Development
- Began with run py 
- With certain changes, run py file was duplicated and number incremented by one
- One reason was to allow for development from run 10 py to run14 py
	- and then combine new version of line check from that subset of code being worked on with original code
	- to form run15 recombine py
- There is probably a better way maybe involving using git branch and git merge but I am not familiar with these.

## Unsolved Errors
- Potentially in code for run16 py and previous versions x and y should be reversed, but for the sake of time these will be left as is.
- run11 py has 2 problems with the linter
