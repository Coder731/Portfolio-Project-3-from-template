Consider wrapping whole game in in while loop
this would created nested while loops
1st loop:
    checks if user enters a name
    or allow any input
    or remove asking for user name

Consider player 1 player 2

## Deprecated: This Step: Add assignment for incorporating user choice into board

use code:
    values["a"] = the_new_value

## Deprecated: Next Step: present board

## Deprecated Step 1: This Step:
Change first Square of board to an X on user input

## This Step:
Check if board is full

## Next Step:
add logic for three in a line (row/col/diagonal)
