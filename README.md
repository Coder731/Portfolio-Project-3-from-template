# Other Notes

## Multiple README files Explanation
There are currently 3 README files:
1. This one, README.md is the main README here in root directory
2. [README2.md](readme_for_template/README2.md) is the second README, which comes with the [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) used
3. [README3_from_original_repo_pre_template.md](readme_2_and_3/readme3_from_original_repo_pre_template/README3_from_original_repo_pre_template.md) is the third README, which comes from the original [Portfolio_Project_3](readme_2_and_3/readme3_from_original_repo_pre_template/README3_from_original_repo_pre_template.md) Repository used before restarting using [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to allow front end use and display of python application

## Development Continued

### Phase 0
Error present in terminal: 
- flake8 error E231 
- Fixed by using: [flake8 error E231 after a successful black run #1289](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1289)
    - step 1: try to run black run.py
        - black not installed
    - step 2: pip3 install black 
    - step 3: black run.py
    - step 4: flake8 run.py

#### Error with gitpod.yml
- gitpod.yml ms-toolsai.jupyter extension is not synced, but not added in .gitpod.yml
- fixed by clicking on i in image in gitpod.yml to see error message, and addressing this.

### Phase 1
print statement is now running

### Phase 2
run:
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
this adds the following dependencies to the requirements.txt file:

black==21.8b0
click==8.0.1
pathspec==0.9.0
regex==2021.8.28
tomli==1.2.1

### Phase 3 Board Display
- Add vertical lines (pipes) between squares horizontally
- Add underscores between squares vertically

### Phase 4 Display two sequential boards
- Board A
    - Present choice to user
- Board B
    - Display user choice

## Debugging
 ### Bug Brackets displaying on board
 Description
 - Brackets displaying
 Attempted Solution
 - Find out if board be displayed without brackets.

### Complex Bug
Keywords for Error:
- Flake Error with Syntax Error with conversion of values List to Dictionary 

Flake Error:
Erorr Message:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Erorr Detail:
- {
	"resource": "/workspace/Portfolio-Project-3-from-template/run.py",
	"owner": "python",
	"code": "E999",
	"severity": 8,
	"message": "SyntaxError: invalid syntax",
	"source": "flake8",
	"startLineNumber": 27,
	"startColumn": 12,
	"endLineNumber": 27,
	"endColumn": 12
}
Error Further Information:
- Error appears in Problems Section of Gitpod/VSCode IDE beside  Output and Terminal tabs

Attempted Solution:
- Searched error

## Note on Development
- Began with run py 
- With certain changes, run py file was duplicated and number incremented by one
- One reason was to allow for development from run 10 py to run14 py
	- and then combine new version of line check from that subset of code being worked on with original code
	- to form run15 recombine py
- There is probably a better way maybe involving using git branch and git merge but I am not familiar with these.

## Unsolved Errors
- Potentially in code for run16 py and previous versions x and y should be reversed, but for the sake of time these will be left as is.
- run11 py has 2 problems with the linter
