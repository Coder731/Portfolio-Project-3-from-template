Consider wrapping whole game in in while loop
this would created nested while loops
1st loop:
    checks if user enters a name
    or allow any input
    or remove asking for user name

Consider player 1 player 2

## Deprecated: This Step: Add assignment for incorporating user choice into board

use code:
    values["a"] = the_new_value

## Deprecated: Next Step: present board

## Deprecated Step 1: This Step:
Change first Square of board to an X on user input

## Deprecated: This Step:
Check if board is full

## Deprecated: Next Step:
add logic for three in a line (row/col/diagonal)

## Deprecated: Current Step:
- Combine is_game_over function with matrix row counting code

## Step 1:
- Find out how to index a list

## Step 2:
- Change for loop index from r in board, which is a list [" ", " ", " "]
    - to a counter
    - use range(len(board))
